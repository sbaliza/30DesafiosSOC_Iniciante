# **Day#7: Wireshark Basics – ICMP Protocol Analysis**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
The objective of this lab is to help students understand and analyze **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** packets using **Wireshark**. Students will learn to identify echo requests/replies, interpret ICMP packet fields, and apply relevant filters for investigation.

## 📘 **ICMP Packet Structure and Fields**

ICMP is a Layer 3 protocol used for sending error messages and operational information. The most common ICMP messages include **Echo Request (Type 8)** and **Echo Reply (Type 0)**.

### **Key ICMP Fields:**

| Field Name       | Description                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Type**         | Defines the ICMP message type        |
| **Code**         | Provides further detail for the type |
| **Checksum**     | Error-checking for header            |
| **Identifier**   | Helps match requests and replies     |
| **Sequence No.** | Sequence of the request/reply        |
| **Data**         | Optional payload                     |

## 🔍 **Most Common ICMP Display Filters**

Use these filters in Wireshark’s **Display Filter** bar:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `icmp` | Show all ICMP traffic |
| `icmp.type == 8` | Show Echo Requests (ping) |
| `icmp.type == 0` | Show Echo Replies |
| `icmp.code == 3` | Destination unreachable |
| `ip.addr == 192.168.1.10` | ICMP traffic from/to specific host |

## ✅ Conclusion
- ICMP is a fundamental protocol for network troubleshooting.
- Wireshark helps visualize ICMP packet flow and structure.
- Understanding ICMP helps detect network scanning, ping sweeps, and unreachable hosts.
