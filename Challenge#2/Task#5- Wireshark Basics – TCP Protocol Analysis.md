# **Lab#10: Wireshark Basics – TCP Protocol Analysis**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
The objective of this lab is to introduce students to analyzing **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** traffic using **Wireshark**. Students will learn how TCP establishes connections, the 3-way handshake process, and how to interpret common TCP fields and flags.

---

## 🛠️ **Lab Setup**

### **System Requirements**
- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11 (or Linux/macOS)
- **Software:** Wireshark (latest version)

### **Files Needed**
- **TCP Sample PCAP File:** [Download TCP pcap](https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures#TCP)  
  *(Example: `tcp-3way-handshake.pcap` or similar from sample captures)*

## 📘 **TCP Packet Structure and Fields**

TCP is a **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)** protocol that ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications.

### **Key TCP Fields:**

| Field Name         | Description                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Source Port**     | Sender’s port number                         |
| **Destination Port**| Receiver’s port number                       |
| **Sequence Number** | Number of the first byte in the segment      |
| **Acknowledgment No** | Confirms received data                    |
| **Flags**           | Control bits (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, PSH, URG) |
| **Window Size**     | Buffer size available                        |
| **Checksum**        | Error-checking field                         |

## 🔍 **Most Common TCP Display Filters**

Use these filters in Wireshark’s **Display Filter** bar:

| Filter                  | Description                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `tcp`                   | Show all TCP packets                     |
| `tcp.flags.syn == 1`    | Show SYN packets (start of connection)   |
| `tcp.flags.fin == 1`    | Show FIN packets (end of connection)     |
| `tcp.port == 80`        | Show TCP packets on port 80              |
| `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1`| TCP traffic to/from a specific host      |

## ✅ Conclusion
- TCP ensures reliable and ordered data delivery through its 3-way handshake and flow control.
- Understanding TCP flags is essential for:
 - Connection state tracking
 - Troubleshooting dropped or reset connections
 - Detecting scanning and abnormal behavior (e.g., RST floods)

## Submission
Submit a screenshot showing:
- Show all TCP packets
- Show SYN packets (start of connection)
- Show FIN packets (end of connection)
- TCP traffic to/from a specific host
