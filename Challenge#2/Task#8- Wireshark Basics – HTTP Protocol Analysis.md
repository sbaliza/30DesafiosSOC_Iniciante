# **Lab#13: Wireshark Basics – HTTP Protocol Analysis**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
The objective of this lab is to help students analyze **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** packets using **Wireshark**. Students will explore HTTP request/response headers, understand how web communication works, and learn how to detect common HTTP-based attacks or data leaks.

---

## 🛠️ **Lab Setup**

### **System Requirements**
- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11 (or Linux/macOS)
- **Software:** Wireshark (latest version)

### **Files Needed**
- **HTTP Sample PCAP File:** [Download HTTP pcap](https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures#HTTP)  
  *(Example: `http.cap` or `http.pcap` from Wireshark sample captures)*

## 📘 **HTTP Packet Structure and Fields**

HTTP is an **application-layer protocol** used for communication between clients (browsers) and web servers. It typically runs over TCP port **80**.

### **Key HTTP Fields:**

| Field Name         | Description                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Request Method** | GET, POST, HEAD, etc.                    |
| **Host**           | The website being accessed               |
| **User-Agent**     | Information about the client/browser     |
| **URI**            | Resource path on the server              |
| **Status Code**    | Server's response status (e.g., 200 OK)  |
| **Content-Type**   | MIME type of the response (e.g., text/html) |
| **Cookie/Header**  | Session or tracking information          |

## 🔍 **Most Common HTTP Display Filters**

Use these filters in Wireshark’s **Display Filter** bar:

| Filter                    | Description                              |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `http`                   | Show all HTTP traffic                    |
| `tcp.port == 80`         | HTTP traffic by default port             |
| `http.request.method == "GET"` | Show all GET requests             |
| `http.request.uri`       | View requested resources                 |
| `http.set_cookie`        | Show cookies in HTTP responses           |
| `ip.addr == 192.168.1.10`| HTTP traffic to/from specific host       |

## ✅ Conclusion
- HTTP traffic is readable and easy to analyze in Wireshark.
- Analyzing HTTP helps detect:
 - Sensitive data exposure in URLs or headers
 - Malware beaconing to C2 servers
 - Suspicious file downloads or unauthorized access

## 📸 Submission
Submit a screenshot showing:
- Show all HTTP traffic
- Show all GET requests
- View requested resources
