# Day#18- Splunk Basics: Investigating SSH Brute Force attack

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to use Splunk to detect and investigate an SSH brute-force attack by analyzing failed login logs and identifying suspicious IPs using basic SPL queries.


---

## 🛠️ Lab Setup

- **Ubuntu Server** (22.04 or later)  
- [Download Linux Auth log sample](https://github.com/0xrajneesh/30-Days-SOC-Challenge-Beginner/blob/main/linux_auth_logs.json)

---

## Pre-requisite

- [Setting up Splunk Server on Ubuntu Server](https://github.com/0xrajneesh/90-Days-SOC-Challenge-Beginner/blob/main/Challenge%234/Task%231-Setting%20up%20Splunk.md)

---

## Lab Task

📥 Submit the answers below along with screenshots from your Splunk queries.


- Question 1: Which user has attempted most number of SSH brute attack attempt?

- Question 2: What is the IP Address of the user “thor”?

- Question 3: How many times user “thor” failed to login?




## ✅ Conclusion

You used Splunk to spot repeated SSH login failures, identify attacker IPs, and understand how brute-force attacks appear in log data — a key SOC analyst skill.
