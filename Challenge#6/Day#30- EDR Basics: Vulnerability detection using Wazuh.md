# 🧪 Lab: EDR Basics - Vulnerability Detection using Wazuh

---

## 🎯 Objective

To detect system vulnerabilities using Wazuh’s built-in vulnerability detection module and understand how a SOC Analyst can identify and mitigate vulnerabilities using alert data.

---

## 🧠 What is a Vulnerability?

A **vulnerability** is a weakness or flaw in software, hardware, or system configuration that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.

---

## 🧨 Types of Vulnerabilities

| Type                  | Example                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Software Bugs**      | Buffer overflow in Apache                |
| **Misconfigurations**  | SSH root login enabled                   |
| **Outdated Software**  | Unpatched Windows or Linux packages      |
| **Default Credentials**| Admin:admin on routers or web apps       |
| **Open Ports/Services**| FTP open with anonymous access           |

---

## 🔎 How Are Vulnerabilities Discovered?

- **Vulnerability Scanners** like OpenVAS, Nessus, or Wazuh's built-in modules
- **Threat Intelligence Feeds**
- **Manual Testing** and Penetration Testing
- **Bug Bounty Programs**
- **Exploit Databases** (e.g., NVD, Exploit-DB)

---

## 🛡️ How Do SOC Analysts Mitigate Vulnerabilities?

- Prioritize based on CVSS score and asset criticality
- Coordinate with IT to apply patches or updates
- Disable or restrict vulnerable services
- Monitor for exploit attempts (IDS/EDR)
- Document and track remediation through ticketing systems

## 🖥️ Lab Setup

| Component        | Description                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Wazuh Server** | Ubuntu with Wazuh Manager + Dashboard |
| **Wazuh Agent**  | Ubuntu machine with agent installed  |

## 📌 Task: Detecting and Visualizing System Vulnerabilities using Wazuh

---

### Step 1: Setting up Vulnerability Detection on Wazuh Agent

1. Ensure the Wazuh agent is **already installed** and connected to the manager.

2. On the Wazuh server, enable **vulnerability-detector module**:  
   Edit the Wazuh configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
   ```
   Enable and configure the module:

  ```
  <vulnerability-detector>
    <enabled>yes</enabled>
    <interval>12h</interval>
    <providers>
      <provider name="canonical">yes</provider>  <!-- For Ubuntu -->
    </providers>
  </vulnerability-detector>
 ```
3. Restart the Wazuh manager to apply changes:

```
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
```
4. Wazuh agent will now scan installed packages and compare them against vulnerability databases like NVD and Canonical Security Tracker.

### Step 2: Visualizing Vulnerability Alerts in Wazuh Dashboard
1. Go to the Wazuh Dashboard.
2. Navigate to:
`Security Events → Rule Groups → vulnerability-detector`
3. Filter by alert level ≥ 10 to find high-severity vulnerabilities.
4. View detailed data:
- CVE ID (e.g., CVE-2023-####)
- Affected package
- CVSS score
- Recommendation to patch or update

### Submission
Submit:
- Screenshot of at least one vulnerability alert on the dashboard
- Description of the vulnerable package, CVE, and CVSS score
- Suggested mitigation step

### Learning Outcome
After completing this lab, you will:
- Understand how vulnerabilities are detected by Wazuh EDR.
- Enable and configure Wazuh’s vulnerability detector.
- View and interpret CVE alerts on the dashboard.
- Learn how SOC analysts triage and respond to system vulnerabilities.
- Strengthen your endpoint detection and response (EDR) fundamentals.
